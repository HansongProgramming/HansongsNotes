# Getting to know your data
## Data Sets
- Files that contain one - more records
- Record = basic unit of information
- collection of related data sets is called a database
- ## Types of Data Sets
	- ### Records
		- AKA "Relational records"
		- Composed of data matrix such as numerical, matrix or crosstabs
		- Can be document data, such as texts documents, or transaction data
	- ### Graph and Network
		- Data collected from the WWW
		- Includes socmed and info network data
		- presented as molecular structures to show connection of data
	- ### Ordered
		- Linear data with a specific order
		- videos / sequence of images
		- temporal data such as time series
		- transaction sequences
		- genetic sequence data
	- ### Spatial, Image and Multimedia Data
		- Spatial data covers different types of geographic data
		- individual image files
		- multimedia data looks at video data in a nonspecific manner
## Structured Data
- Data in standardized format
- Type of data that has a well-defined structure, complies w/ data models, follows persistent order
- Foundation of big data as it is easily accessed by humans and programs
	- #### Characteristics
		- Identifiable structure that conforms to a data model
		- Data is presented in rows and columns, such as in a database
		- easy to understand
		- data is fixed fields in a file or record
		- has similar groups or clustered in classes
		- points in the same group have the same attributes
		- information is easy to access
		- data's elements are addressable
	- #### Examples
		- Machine generated data
			- sensor data
			- web logs
			- POS details
			- Financial info
		- Human Generated data
			- Survey responses
			- Click-stream data
			- Move-by-move breakdown of actions in a game
## Unstructured Data
- lacks identifiable nature
- does not conform to a predicted data model
- hard to read and understand by a computer or human which makes it unfit for traditional database
	- #### Characteristics
		- Data neither conforms to a data model or has any structure
		- Cannot be stored in a database
		- does not follow any semantics or rules
		- lacks any particular format or sequence
	- #### Examples
		- Documents (Word, pdf, ppt, text)
		- Transcripts of Customer Service Calls
		- Images on the net (JPEG, PNGs, GIFs, etc)
		- Media logs
		- web pages
		- videos
		- user comments
		- memos
		- reports
		- survey responses
# Data Objects
- Made up of data sets
- Data object represents an entity
- (Sales data base, medical database, univ database) - > (customers, store items, patients, treatments, students, professors, courses, sales)
- also called samples, examples instances, data points, objects, tuples
- Data objects are described by attributes
- Database rows are data objects
- Database columns are the attributes
# Attributes
- Data fields representing a characteristic of feature of a data object
- "Customer_ID, Name, Address"
- These are four types of attributes that can be assigned to the data object
	- Nominal
		- Type Refers to categories states or names of things
		- Example: 
			- hair_Color = {auburn, black, blonde, brown, grey, red, white}
	- Binary
		- Nominal Attribute with only two states (0 / 1)
			- Symmetric binary: Both outcomes are equally important (ex. citizenship)
			- Asymmetric binary: outcomes are not equally important (ex. medical test's positive vs negative like HIV positive or negative)
	- Ordinal
		- have a meaningful order or ranking
		- magnitude between successive values is not known
		- Examples:
			- size = {small, medium, large}
			- grades , army ranks, security clearance
	- Numeric
		- Interval
			- Measured on a scale of equal-sized units
			- have order
			- have no true "zero point"
			- "Calendar dates"
		- Ratio
			- has inherit "zero point"
			- are an order of magnitude larger than unit of measurement
				- 10 kelvin is twice as high as 5 kelvin
			- Examples: temp in kelvin, length, counts, monetary quantities
- #### Discrete Attributes
	- have only finite or countable set of values
	- represented as int variables
		- ex: computers in lab room, inv in grocery store, nationality on passport
- #### Continuous Attributes
	- Have real numbers as attribute values
	- are typically represented as floating point
		- ex: temps, height, weight

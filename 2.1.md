# Data Collection
- ## Defining Data Collection
	- Methodological process of gathering information about a specific subject
	- w/o data no analysis can be done, and no decisions can be made
	- Data collected can vary, ranging from product demand, to customer satisfaction
	- The type of data you collect should align with your goals
	- identify your sources of data to ensure that they can be accessed or collected from
	- you can use just one data collection method or multiple data collection methods
- ## Importance of Data Collection
	- Proper data collection is an important part of research
	- determines quality and accuracy of collected data
	-  helps reduce bias and increases representativeness
	- helps in making informed decisions
	- supports validity of research findings
- ## Data Collection sources
	- #### Primary data
		- first hand information, collected by you
		- collected for the first time
		- typically original and more reliable
			{historical documents, Literary texts, Artistic works
			Experiments, Photograph Records, Live recordings,
			Diaries, memoirs, auto biographies, surveys and interviews}
	- #### Secondary data
		- Second hand information
		- data not originally collected and rather obtained from already existing or published sources
		- data has been already processed, organized, and analyzed by others
			{Print media - books magazines, newspapers},
			{government data - demographics, economic trends},
			{commercial data - sales data, customer feedback},
			{Academic data - research surveys, study data}
			{Online Data - social media posts, web analytics, reviews}
			{Organizational Data - financial records, customer satisfaction}
			{Big data - sensor data, IOT data, phone data}
	- #### Tertiary Data
		- secondary data that has been aggregated into one source
		- typically gives overview of information gathered from primary and secondary data
		- does not give original interpretations or analysis
			{Dictionaries, Encyclopedias, research databases, bibliographies}
- ## Data collection methods
	- #### Quantitative
		- numerical, analyzed through statistical methods
		- seeks to quantify and measure variables in a systematic and objective way
		- Data is often used to identify patterns or correlations between variables
		- Experiments
		- surveys
		- observation
		- archival research
		- secondary data collection
	- #### Qualitative
		- commonly used for non numerical
		- experience based topics 
		- qualitative data research can provide insights into human behavior and experiences
		- observations
		- interviews
		- focus groups
		- surveys
		- secondary data collection

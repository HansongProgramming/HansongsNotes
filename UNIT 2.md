**2 TYPES OF SCIENCE**  
**I. Pure Science**  
	- Scientific research conducted to acquire knowledge (basic research).
	- Focuses on theories of science and predictions to understand the world.
	- Information gathered in pure sciences is helpful in applied sciences.   

**II. Applied Science**  
	- practical use of knowledge  
	- application of theoretical sciences  
	- utilizes scientific information to develop practical solutions  
	- more similar to technology and engineering  

**Technology**  
	--- the application of science in modern living  
	--- the “material artifacts” in anthropological term or “hardware” in engineering term,  
	produced by a person or group of persons  
	--- the system of know how, skills, techniques and processes which enable societies to  
	produce, distribute, install, maintain or improve goods and services needed to satisfy human  
	needs  
	--- is systematic: purposeful manipulation of the material world  
	--- is a process: power is applied through a tool or machine to a certain material by  
	employing a certain technique

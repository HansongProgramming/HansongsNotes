		3. Meteorology is the study of the Earth's atmosphere, weather patterns, and climatic conditions. It delves into the dynamics of the atmosphere, including temperature, humidity, and air pressure, to predict and understand weather phenomena.
		
		4. Geography explores the Earth's physical features, human populations, and the relationships between them. It encompasses the study of landscapes, cultures, and the distribution of resources, providing insights into the interconnectedness of the world.
		
		5. Paleontology focuses on the study of ancient life through the examination of fossils. It seeks to understand the evolution and diversity of past organisms, offering valuable insights into the history of life on Earth.

## II. SOCIAL SCIENCE
Social science is the investigation the associated behaviors whether individual or collective behaviors from individuals or groups, societies, and economies. It is classifiable to other sub-categories such as psychology “the science of human behaviors”, sociology “the science of social groups”, and economics “the science of firms, markets, and economies”. In a shorter manner, it is the analyzation of humans and the interactions they have.

Is a broad field of study that investigates human society and individual behavior. It encompasses various disciplines that explore different aspects of human interactions, institutions, and cultural phenomena.

**Branches of Social Science**

1.  Sociology examines the structure, development, and functioning of human societies. It explores social relationships, institutions, and how they shape individuals and communities, aiming to understand patterns of behavior and societal changes.

2.  Psychology focuses on the study of the mind and behavior. It explores cognitive processes, emotions, and the factors influencing individual and group behavior, shedding light on mental processes and the complexities of human thought.

3.  Political Science analyzes political systems, institutions, and the distribution of power. It delves into the study of governments, policies, and political behavior, aiming to understand how political structures influence societies.

4.  Economics studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It explores the principles of resource allocation, economic systems, and the factors influencing financial decision-making at individual and societal levels.

5.  Archaeology investigates human history through the excavation and analysis of artifacts and structures. It aims to reconstruct and understand past cultures, technologies, and lifestyles by examining material remains.

6.  History chronicles and interprets past events, cultures, and societies. It explores the evolution of human civilization over time, providing insights into the factors that have shaped the present.

7. Anthropology studies humanity in its entirety, examining biological, cultural, and social aspects. It encompasses the study of diverse human societies, their origins, development, and cultural practices, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of human existence.



# **Scientific Method:**

According to sources, scientific method is an attempt in pursuit of discerning activities by which success is achieved. These are the activities of science that are systematic in observation and experimentation, this also includes inductive and deductive reasoning, and the formation and testing of hypotheses and theories.

**Sir Francis Bacon:**

Francis Bacon (1561–1626) an English philosopher, statesman, scientist, and author during the Renaissance period. Often regarded as one of the pioneers of the scientific method creating and improving inductive reasoning. Bacon played a significant role in the development of modern science and philosophy.

**STEPS**

1.  Observation and Statement of the problem:

            Before everything, one must need to address a specific problem and define what is it that they want from the problem. It should be able to outline the problem and briefly address the question “what is the problem the research wants to address? “.

2. Formulation of hypothesis:

            Hypothesis is a temporary statement proposing a solution to a problem. It offers a solution to be verified empirically with basis on some rationale. Hypothesis converts the researchers to make a systematic way towards a achieving a desired goal or output. Important characteristics of a hypothesis include clarity, specificity, empirically testable and being related to a body of theory.

3. Gathering of data and facts

            Data gathering is the collection and evaluation of information or data from multiple reliable sources to find answers or understanding to research problems. Data gathering must answer questions, sometimes one must also evaluate outcomes from the inputs, and come up with probabilities and ideas.

Data:

Is a collection of raw and untouched facts, meaning there will be no pre-processing from humans.

Data comes in two types:

Quantitative

            From the root word, Quantity, meaning something is quantifiable or comes in numerical forms of data.

Qualitative

            Comes in wordy and sentence-based data, in nature it is needed to be interpreted and understood using descriptive techniques.

Facts

            These are truths or certain pieces of truth that is gathered to make data.

4. Recording and analyzing the data

Data table

            A data table is a range of cells within a table where you are able to manipulate values within the table. This way you are able to come up with different answers to a given problem.

Graph

            Visualized representations of data to provide ease of access and better understanding for researchers.

5. Drawing of conclusion or Generalization:

            A crucial step that involving synthesizing results of an experiment or study. It typically follows the analysis of collected data. Scientists use this step to make inferences or derive broader insights from their findings

Conclusion

            The last part of something, usually the end or result. In this part you make an idea solid using the data you have gathered.

Generalization

            An act of reasoning where drawing broad inferences and statements from particular observations in the study.

Theory

            These are theories formulated to explain phenomena, and in many cases challenging pre-existing knowledge or theorems.

Law

            Is the basic principles, generalization and regularity.

6. Communicate Your Results

            This is done by writing and publishing research articles and using audio visual tools to present these at meetings or conferences.

**Variables in an experiment (Definitions and Examples)**

1. Independent variable

            An independent variable stands alone, it does not need any other variables to prove its worth nor needs to be with others to create change.

2. Dependent variable

            Dependent variables depend on other factors to prove its word

3. Constant variables

            These are variables that are the same throughout the experiment.

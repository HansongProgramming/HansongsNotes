# Defining Data mining
- Process of sorting through large data sets
- identification of patterns and relationships
- solve business problems through data analysis
- techniques & tools allow prediction of trends
- describes target dataset
- predicts outcomes using machine learning
# Data Mining Model
- Serves as a foundation on how data will be identified, collected and processed
- CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
	- Standardized model that highlights steps needed in data analysis
	- Most frequently used data mining model
	- has six key phases
		#### Business Understanding
		- Set goals of business
		- the important factors that helps in achieving goal are discovered
		### Data Understanding
		- where data is collected and populated in a tool (if using a tool)
		### Data Preparation
		- Involves selecting appropriate data, cleaning, constructing attributes, and integrating data from multiple databases.
		### Modeling
		- Involves Selecting the data mining techniques such as decision trees, generating test designs for evaluating the selected model, building models, forming data sets and assessing the built model with experts
		### Evaluation
		- Determines the degree to which the resulting model meets the business requirements
		### Deployment
		- Where deployments are made
		- Strategy to monitor and maintain data mining model to check for its usefulness is formed 
# Where Data is Collected
		- Relational Databases
		- Data Warehouses
		- Transactional Databases
		- Spatial Databases
		- Multimedia Database
		- Text Database
		- world wide web
# Data Mining Model
## Three Key Phases
- ### Data Collection
	- #### Data Scraping
		- involves extracting large amount of data from websites and storing it in a local machine
	- #### Data Crawling
		- Reads web page content in order to index the content of the website
- ### Data Preprocessing
	- #### Data Cleaning
		- Involves removing noise and inconsistent data from the input data
	- #### Data Integration
		- involves combining multiple sources of data
	- #### Data Selection
		- selection of data from database to be used for analysis
- ### Data Analysis
	- ### Data Transformation
		- use of data aggregation and data summary techniques to transform data into a useful form for mining
	- #### Data Mining
		- Extraction of data patterns by applying different intelligent methods
	- #### Pattern Evaluation
		- looks at evaluating and recognizing extracted data patterns according to the relevance and interest measures

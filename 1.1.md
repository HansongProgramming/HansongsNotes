# Defining Data mining
- Process of sorting through large data sets
- identification of patterns and relationships
- solve business problems through data analysis
- techniques & tools allow prediction of trends
- describes target dataset
- predicts outcomes using machine learning
# Data Mining Model
- Serves as a foundation on how data will be identified, collected and processed
- CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
	- Standardized model that highlights steps needed in data analysis
	- Most frequently used data mining model
	- has six key phases
		#### Business Understanding
		- Set goals of business
		- the important factors that helps in achieving goal are discovered
		### Data Understanding
		- where data is collected and populated in a tool (if using a tool)
		### Data Preparation
		- Involves selecting appropriate data, cleaning, constructing attributes, and integrating data from multiple databases.
		### Modeling
		- Involves Selecting the data mining techniques such as decision trees, generating test designs for evaluating the selected model, building models, forming data sets and assessing the built model with experts
		### Evaluation
		- Determines the degree to which the resulting model meets the business requirements
		### Deployment
		- Where deployments are made
		- Strategy to monitor and maintain data mining model to check for its usefulness is formed 
# Where Data is Collected
		- Relational Databases
		- Data Warehouses
		- Transactional Databases
		- Spatial Databases
		- Multimedia Database
		- Text Database
		- world wide web
# Data Mining Model
## Three Key Phases
- ### Data Collection
	- #### Data Scraping
		- involves extracting large amount of data from websites and storing it in a local machine
	- #### Data Crawling
		- Reads web page content in order to index the content of the website
- ### Data Preprocessing
	- #### Data Cleaning
		- Involves removing noise and inconsistent data from the input data
	- #### Data Integration
		- involves combining multiple sources of data
	- #### Data Selection
		- selection of data from database to be used for analysis
- ### Data Analysis
	- ### Data Transformation
		- use of data aggregation and data summary techniques to transform data into a useful form for mining
	- #### Data Mining
		- Extraction of data patterns by applying different intelligent methods
	- #### Pattern Evaluation
		- looks at evaluating and recognizing extracted data patterns according to the relevance and interest measures
	- ### Knowledge Representation
		- Visualization and knowledge representation techniques to present the mined knowledge to users
- # Data Mining Technique
	- ## Classification
		- Analysis used to retrieve important and relevant information about data and metadata
		- helps classify data in different classes
		- complex data mining technique that requires you to combine various attributes together into discernable categories
		- you can then use these categories to draw further conclusions
	- ## Clustering
		- Classification, but involves grouping chunks of data together based on their categories
	- ## Regression
		- Data mining technique that identifies and analyzes the relationship between variables
		- Identifies the likelihood of specific variable given the presence of other variables
		- Primarily used as a form of planning and modeling
	- ## Association Rules
		- Finds association between two or more items
		- Discovers hidden patterns in data set
		- look for events or attributes that are highly correlated with another event or attribute
	- ## Outlier Detection
		- Understanding anomalies in your dataset and why they occur
		- Can be used in variety of domains such as intrusion, detection, fraud
	- ## Sequential Patterns
		- Helps discover or identify similar patterns or trends in transaction data for a certain period
		- recognition of some aberration in your data happening at regular intervals
	- ## Prediction
		- Combination of other data mining techniques
		- Analyzes past events or instances in a right sequence for predicting a future event
		- To protect types of data you'll see in the future
		- Recognizing and understanding historical trends can help give accurate predictions
	- What type of data attribute has values with a meaningful order or ranking, where the magnitude between successive values is not known? 
		- # Ordinal 
	- What type of data attribute has values which are categories, states, or “names of things”?
		- # Nominal

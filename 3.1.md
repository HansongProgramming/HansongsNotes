# Data Collection, Image and Text
## Defining Image Collection  
- Images are a visual or mental representation of something or someone.  
- In data science, these images have a class or type that they belong to.  
- Different types of images are used to conduct analysis and train modern systems.
- Refers to the practice of utilizing digital images for research and data science
## Collecting image data
- know what type of images you want to collect
- ### Characteristics
	- images organized around specific themes or categories
	- glean patterns in our data
	- characteristics of our image data
		Data - Viewable image or the analytic content from img
		Metadata - Camera maker, model, image, timestep, aperture, shutter speed, caption, author, legal info, copyright info
		Paradata - Image Source/s, image file type, image edit history, image sharing history
# Defining text collection
- Refers to printed books documents and media that cover different ideas and content
- Text Collection is a type of data that deals with unstructured text data
- it typically makes use of NLP
- Text collection has two key phases in its process
	- Text refining
		- Transforming free-form text to a chosen intermediate form (IF)
		- makes it easier to process and organize the text
		- IF typically has labels for the individual text or tags which describe topic or idea
		- Mining a document based IF deduces patterns and relationship across documents
	- knowledge distillation
		- Deduces patterns or knowledge from IF
		- utilization of analysis tools or machine learning models
		- methods used = "text Data "+ (Categorization, extraction, identification, parsing, translation, visualization)
# Managing text data
- We store both raw and analyzed together
- allows validity of text refining process
- ensures correct interpretation
- keep raw to utilize multiple techniques
- processing data is iterative in nature
- we better understand data as we analyze
- corpora at the end of our mining process
- collection of linguistic patterns that we have analyzed from our text data
- allows prediction and analysis
- rebuilding a text mining tool rebuilds the corpora

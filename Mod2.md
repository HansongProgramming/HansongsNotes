# Profession
- A profession can be understood in terms of the attributes and requirements of a professional practice, such as "calling in which special knowledge and skill are used in...the service of mankind." (Firmage, 1991)
- Greenwood (1991) believes that professions are occupational fields distinguishable in terms of five characteristics: (i) systematic theory, (ii) authority, (iii) community sanction, (iv) ethical codes, and (v) a culture
# Professional Ethics
- When applied to computing, professional ethics is a field of applied ethics concerned with moral issues that impact computer professionals.
- ## Why separate category for ethics?
	- The same ethical rule involving honesty, fairness, and so forth should apply to professional as well as to ordinary individuals.
	- So, if it is wrong for ordinary people to steal, cheat, lie and so forth, then it is wrong for professionals to do so as well.
- # Who is a Professional
	- professional is a member of a profession or any person who earns their living from a specified professional activity.
	- Those who comprise a given profession also tend to have certain defining attributes and requirements.
	- Computer Professional is anyone who is employed in the computer, IT or any IT related fields.

		- No administrative body to accredit professional education programs
		- no administrative body to assess and ensure competency of individual professionals
- ## IT Professional Malpractice
	- Negligence has been defined as not doing something that a       reasonable man would do, or doing something that a reasonable man would not do
	- Duty of care refers to the obligation to protect people against any unreasonable harm or risk
	- Courts consistently reject attempts to sue individual parties for computer-related malpractice
- # Ethical Guidelines for Computer Professionals
	- Understand what success means
	- Include users
	- Do a thorough, careful job when planning and scheduling a project and when writing bids or contracts
	- design for real users
- # Common Ethical Issues for IT users
	- ## Privacy
		- Most people have their personal data spread throughout the digital world. Even things thought to be secure, such as email or private accounts, can be accessed by unintended sources.
		- Most employers actively check their employees' computer habits. Privacy has evolving legal implications, but there are also ethical considerations.
	- ## Digital Ownership
		-  Digital mediums have allowed information to flow more freely than before. This exchange of ideas comes with a legal and ethical backlash.
		- How can ownership be established in the digital realm? Things can be easily copied and pasted online, which makes intellectual property hard to control.
	- ## Data Gathering
		- The United States has even passed legislation allowing the government to actively monitor private citizens in the name of national security.
		- These measures have revived a debate about what information can be gathered and why. This debate applies on a smaller scale as well because companies need to consider what information to collect from their employees.
	- ## Security Liability
		- Security systems for digital networks are computerized in order to protect vital information and important assets. However, this increased security comes with increased surveillance.
		- All security systems have inherent risks, which means it is a question of what risks are acceptable and what freedoms can be forfeited.
		-  Ultimately, IT professionals need to balance risk with freedom to create a security system that is effective an ethical at the same time.
	- ## Access Costs
		- Net neutrality has become a trendy issue thanks to legislative efforts in the last few years. The issue of net neutrality is essentially a question of access.
		- Proponents want the Internet to remain open to everyone while some businesses want to create tiered access for those who are willing to pay. The issue even extends to private Internet usage since the cost of service in some areas may be cost prohibitive.
	- ## Cyber-ethics
		- Study of moral, legal, and social issues
		- Examines impact that cybertechnology has for our social, legal, and moral systems
		- evaluates social policies and laws that have been framed in response to issues generated by the development and use of cybertechnology.
		- # Examples of Cyberethical questions:
			- Is it OK to display personal information about others on the Internet?
			- Should users be protected from false information?
			- Who owns digital data and what should users be allowed to do with it?
			- How much access should there be to gambling and pornography online?
			- Is access to the Internet a basic right that everyone should have?
		- ## CyberTechnology
			- Cybertechnology refers to a wide range of computing and communications devices â€” from standalone computers, to "connected" or networked computing and communications technologies, to the Internet itself.
			- Cybertechnologies include: hand-held devices (such as Palm Pilots), personal computers (desktops and laptops), mainframe computers, and so forth.
		
| Phase | Time period | Tech feature | Issue |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 1950-1960s | Standalone machines (large mainframe computers) | AI (big brother) |
| 2 | 1970-1980 | minicomputers and PCs interconnected via private networks | same issues as phase 1 + problems with IP, piracy and cybercrime |
| 3 | 1990- present | Internet | phase 1 and 2 + concerns about free speech, anonymity, and virtual communities |
| 4 | Present to near future | Convergence of information and communication tech and other forms of tech | same issues with all phases + health issues and bots scare (AI taking over) |

Professional Codes of Ethics are guidelines that outline the principles and values important to a specific profession. These codes typically have two parts: one that describes the profession's goals and another that lists rules and principles for members to follow. Following a code of ethics helps professionals make ethical decisions, maintain high standards of practice, and earn trust from the public. It also provides a benchmark for self-assessment and evaluation by peers.

The Case for Licensing IT Workers argues that as IT systems become more critical and complex, licensing IT workers could improve information systems by ensuring adherence to high standards and codes of ethics. Licensing would also allow for punishment of violators. However, there are challenges to implementing licensing programs, such as the lack of a universally accepted body of knowledge, unclear administration of licensing exams, and a lack of accreditation for professional education programs. Additionally, there is no administrative body to assess and ensure the competence of individual workers, which makes it difficult to hold IT workers accountable to high ethical standards through licensing.

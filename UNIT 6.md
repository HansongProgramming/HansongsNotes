# BIODIVERSITY

Used to replace long terms (species diversity & species richness)

Degree of variation in life (Genetic variation, species variation, ecosystem Variation)

# TERRESTRIAL BIODIVERSITY

Highest (low altitudes near equator)

Result of Warm Climate & High marine primary productivity

# MARINE BIODIVERSITY

Highest along coasts (western pacific)

Sea surface temp is highest

Mid-latitudinal band in all oceans

# IMPORTANCE OF BIODIVERSITY

Boosts ecosystem productivity (each species has roles to play)

Larger plant species = greater variety of crops

Greater species diversity = natural sustainability for life forms

Healthy ecosystems = withstanding (disasters)

## RESISTANCE TO CATASTROPHE

###             MONOCULTURE

Lack of biodiversity (Irish potato famine, European wine industry collapse 1800s, Corn Leaf blight epidemic 1970s)

Higher biodiversity = control of disease spread

### DISADVANTAGE OF MONOCULTURE

#### MONOCULTURES

Susceptible to certain weeds and pests

Use of pesticide

Due to lack of biological diversity

EFFECT OF PESTICIDE AND FERTILIZER ON HEALTH

Chemicals finding way to groundwater sources

Air pollution

#### CULTIVATION OF CROPS AND BREEDS

Favors limitation of options

Lessens biodiversity

#### GROWING SAME CROPS

 Depletes Valuable Soil Nutrients (Deficiency compensated by fertilizers)

#### FOOD AND DRINK

Provides food for humans

80% of food supply comes from plants

used at least 40,000 species of plants & animals a day

#### MEDICINES

Significant proportion of drugs are derived from bio sources

40% of pharmaceuticals used in US are found from natural compounds found in living organisms

medicines are derived from microorganisms

#### INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS

derived from biological sources

fibers, dyes, resins, gums, adhesives, rubber, oil.

#### INTELLECTUAL VALUE

field of bionics, lots of tech advancement was made through rich biodiversity

#### BETTER CROP-VARIETIES

wild varieties can be reintroduced to form better variety than domesticated

economic impact is gigantic for common crops (rice, potato)

rice was Improved thousands of years by man, to gain nutritional values that has been lost

#### OTHER ECOLOGICAL SERVICES

recycling nutrients and providing fertile soils

humans cannot easily build ecosystems to support human needs

#### LEISURE, CULTURAL AND AESTHETIC VALUE

walk in the countryside, birdwatching, history programs

inspired artists to show respect for living organisms

## THREATS / LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY

###             HABITAT DESTRUCTION

                Played a key role in extinctions

                Overpopulation, Deforestation, increased road-building

###             INTRODUCED, INVASIVE, ALIEN, EXOTIC SPECIES

                Species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained

                Introduction of exotic species may prove to be a threat in the endemic life’s adaptation to them

                (Lophura Nycthemera *Silver Pheasant)

###             GENETIC POLLUTION

                Uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping.

                Homogenization or replacement of local genomes.

###             OVEREXPLOITATION

                Resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate

                Overhunting, excessive logging, poor soil conservation, illegal wildfire trade

                Endangered species is second in size to drug trafficking, 25% of fisheries are now overfished

###             HYBRIDIZATION, GENETIC EROSION AND FOOD SECURITY

                green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield

                GM organisms have altered genetics through recombitant DNA technology

                Genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution = destroying unique genotypes

###             CLIMATE CHANGE

                Global warming

                Increases atmospheric carbon dioxide affects plant morphology

###             HUMAN OVERPOPULATION

                From 1950 to 2011, world population increased from 2.5 billion to 7 billion.

                Forecast 9B in 21st century

                David King, > human population has more impact on biodiversity than any other

## NUMBER OF SPECIES OR GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY

## BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS

Biodiversity hotspots, regions with high level of biodiversity, threatened by human activities.

The concept was developed by Norman Myers based on regions with at least 0.5% or 1,500 species of vascular plants as endemics and have lost at least 70% of their primary vegetation.

Globally, 25 areas qualify as biodiversity hotspots, with nine other potential candidates. These areas support nearly 60% of the world's plant, bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species, with many being endemic.

## ENDEMIC SPECIES

 Species found only in a particular region, making them vulnerable to extinction. They may become national or regional emblems. Threats include habitat degradation from agriculture, urban growth, mining, logging, and invasive species.

## THREATS AND PROTECTION OF ENDEMIC SPECIES

Since they are often confined to very small areas, and sometimes to unusual and sensitive habitats within these localities, many endemic species are endangered.

Some of the principal causes of habitat degradation and loss in these ecosystems are:

1.  Agriculture

2.  Urban growth

3.  Surface mining and mining of oil, metals and minerals

4.  Large scale logging operations

5.  Slash-and-burn techniques employed by some cultures

6.  Invasive species introduced either intentionally or accidentally

## INDIGENOUS SPECIES

 Species native to a region due to natural processes, without human intervention. They have a natural range of distribution.

## ALIEN SPECIES

Also called exotic, introduced, non-native, or invasive species, they are plants, animals, or microorganisms introduced outside their natural range, often causing environmental or economic problems.

## ALIEN SPECIES CAN GET ESTABLISHED IF GIVEN ADVANTAGES SUCH AS:

1.  an agreeable climate;

2.  no or few natural predators, parasites or diseases;

3.  an abundance of food plants or prey that lack protection against the newcomer; and

4.  an ability to out-compete native species and corner the best resources.

## SOME INTRODUCED ALIEN SPECIES IN THE PHILIPPINES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON ECOSYSTEMS

**Janitor Fish** Originally imported as aquarium cleaners, these South American catfish escaped into Laguna Lake and Marikina River, disrupting the ecosystem, damaging fish cages and fishing nets, affecting fish production, and causing the collapse of riverbanks.

**Golden Apple Snail** Introduced for backyard pond culturing, these snails escaped into rice fields, becoming pests. They caused significant economic losses, leading to control programs and public awareness campaigns.

**Water Hyacinth** Initially brought for decorative purposes, this floating plant reproduced rapidly, clogging water systems and blocking sunlight from reaching other aquatic vegetation.

**Knife Fish** Introduced by hobbyists, these ornamental fish resemble arowana. They have multiplied rapidly, impacting ecosystems and fisheries in Laguna de Bay.

**Chinese Softshell Turtle** This carnivorous and aggressive species preys on fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and insects, disrupting native ecosystems.

**Black Snake Head "DALAG"** These fish feed on fingerlings or shrimps, affecting local aquatic ecosystems.

## Alien Invasive Plant Species

   Large-leaf Mahogany, Paper Mulberry, Hagonoy or Siam Weed, Coronitas or Baho-baho, Ipil-ipil, Chinese Creeper, Yemane or Gmelina, Acacia Mangium, Eucalyptus Camaldulensis, Dipterocarpus Grandiflorus, Water Fern, Water Hyacinth

These alien invasive plant species have negative impacts on native flora and fauna, disrupting ecosystems and threatening biodiversity.

## CITES

(Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora): A treaty ensuring that international trade of wild animals and plants doesn't threaten their survival. It lists species under Appendices I, II, and III based on their conservation status.

## CONSERVATION EFFORTS

  - Philippine Tarsier: Protected under CITES Appendix II, with conservation efforts including a sanctuary in Bohol for eco-tourism and conservation.

  - Philippine Eagle: Critically endangered, conservation efforts include the Philippine Eagle Foundation in Davao City.

  - Tridacna gigas: Giant clams protected under CITES, with laws in the Philippines prohibiting their exploitation.

  - Sea Turtles: Listed as critically endangered, facing threats like habitat loss, hunting, and pollution.

  - Philippine Forest Turtle: Among the 25 most endangered turtles in the world, facing extinction risks.

  - Indopacific Crocodile: Protected under CITES Appendix I, regulating all trade in this species.

- Bioprospecting: Searching for potential pharmaceutical compounds in organisms, regulated to protect resources, promote fair benefit-sharing, and recognize indigenous knowledge.

- Biopiracy: Exploiting indigenous knowledge for commercial gain without permission or compensation, such as patenting natural resources like plants or animals.

- Examples of Biopiracy:

  - Theft of antibiotic extract from soil in Iloilo, leading to the discovery of erythromycin.

  - Patenting of ampalaya and talong by US entities for potential HIV and thrombosis cures.

  - Patenting of Philippine sea snail toxin for pain relief.

- Protected Areas Laws:

  - RA 7586 (NIPAS Act of 1992): Establishes and manages protected areas in the Philippines for conservation and sustainable development.

  - PD 705 (Philippine Forestry Reform Code): Governs the protection and management of forestry resources in the Philippines.

- Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau (PAWB): Under DENR, responsible for managing the protected areas system in the Philippines.

- Conservation Efforts in Other Countries:

  - Rosy Periwinkle: Madagascar's plant source of drugs generating millions for Eli Lilly.

  - Neem Tree: Patented by the CSIR in India for fungicidal properties, leading to legal opposition and eventual revocation of the patent.

  - Hoodia: Patented by CSIR in South Africa for appetite suppression, sublicensed to Pfizer.

These topics highlight the importance of protecting biodiversity and regulating bioprospecting and biopiracy to ensure fair benefit-sharing and conservation of natural resources.
